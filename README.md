# FT_LINEAR_REGRESSION
#### The project is an introduction to Linear Regression and Gradient Descent.

Building a simple Linear Regression model that can predict a car's price based on its mileage, the implementation includes data normalization and gradient descent optimization.

## Usage
Train the model using the training dataset:
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
- Model parameters are saved using pickle for easy reuse

Make predictions using the trained model:
  ```bash
  python predict.py <mileage>
  ```
